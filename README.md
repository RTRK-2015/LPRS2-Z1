## LPRS2 for dummies
* What the hell am I doing?
* Copy code relentlessly
* Use genetic algorithm to evolve the code into a new state of conciousness
* Make random testbenches
* Generate Programming File
* ???
* Doesn't work (no power cable for the E2LP platform)
* Plug in your colleague's cable (he won't be happy)
* Still doesn't work
* Curse the heavens, LPRS2 and God for creating you, only to suffer the horrors of LPRS2
